### what now?

---------------------------------------

## server?:
This week I wanted to create a server and then try to get the client to connect 
it. I did some more research and found some things I wanted to test out. One of 
them was pusher which I spent a lot of time on. Pusher says it allows for easy
bi-directional communication between and client and server.

## broken tutorials?:
I was unsure if the tutorials that pusher provided were broken or the school internet
connection just refused to have them connect. I was not able to connect to pusher through
ruby and wasn't sure if I should try to use the other languages that they support.
After some thinking I realized that this would not be smart of me to do because 
it would be a waste of time if it also didn't work out in the end.

## takeaways:
* Know what you can invest time into
    * Having a sense of how much time left to complete something should influence
    your descisions on what to invest time into. Having more time might have convinced
me to try out pusher more but knowing that I still have no server and only have a few weeks
left, I decided not to.
